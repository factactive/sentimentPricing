2020-04-14 03:14:58,"Atlanta, GA",21,15,2184,0,"While some investors might want a much larger raise, Apple has shown its preference for share buybacks over time. $AAPL"
2020-04-14 03:14:57,"Atlanta, GA",21,15,2184,0,"With cash flow production remaining quite high and the buyback bringing down the share count, I'm looking for another high single digit or low double digit percentage raise. $AAPL"
2020-04-14 03:14:56,"Atlanta, GA",21,15,2184,0,"In the end, Apple investors should be looking forward to another steady dividend raise from the company at the end of this month. $AAPL"
2020-04-14 03:14:56,"Atlanta, GA",21,15,2184,0,"It remains to be seen how much will be spent over the next year, as Apple continues to get its outstanding share count down towards 4 billion and its net cash position towards zero.

$AAPL"
2020-04-14 03:14:55,"Atlanta, GA",21,15,2184,0,"If the company continues its strategy with favoring buybacks, I'm guessing we'll see another $50 billion added to the repurchase program this month. $AAPL"
2020-04-14 03:14:55,"Atlanta, GA",21,15,2184,0,"It will be interesting to see what management did during the latest quarter, given the coronavirus situation as well as share price fall. $AAPL"
2020-04-14 03:14:54,"Atlanta, GA",21,15,2184,0,"As the 10-Q filing linked above detailed, Apple had $58.9 billion left on its buyback program at the end of the December 2019 quarter. $AAPL"
2020-04-14 03:14:54,"Atlanta, GA",21,15,2184,0,"Thus, a raise in the high single digits percentage wise will also keep total cash dividend payments about the same as the prior year period, or potentially up a little if we get a 7 or 8 cent boost.

$AAPL"
2020-04-14 03:14:53,"Atlanta, GA",21,15,2184,0,"While I do think we'll see another solid raise, I'm not going above the average increase detailed above because of the coronavirus hurting results. $AAPL"
2020-04-14 03:14:53,"Atlanta, GA",21,15,2184,0,"Some might ask why I went all the way up to 90 cents with the above table. Well, the largest dividend raise we've seen from the company was about 15.9%, so I wanted to cover that number. $AAPL"
2020-04-14 03:14:52,"Atlanta, GA",21,15,2184,0,"From January 2019 to January 2020, the share count was reduced by more than 7.2%, the most of the past six years. $AAPL"
2020-04-14 03:14:52,"Atlanta, GA",21,15,2184,0,"That smaller raise was likely because the US/China trade war had knocked down shares a bit, and management wanted to favor the buyback. $AAPL"
2020-04-14 03:14:51,"Atlanta, GA",21,15,2184,0,"Last year, the buyback had reduced the share count by just over 7% (from 1/19/18 to 1/18/19), but Apple's dividend raise was the smallest we've seen since it was restarted in 2012.

$AAPL"
2020-04-14 03:14:51,"Atlanta, GA",21,15,2184,0,"We get an updated share count with each 10-Q filing, and the most updated numbers go from January to January since we don't have the April figure in yet. $AAPL"
2020-04-14 03:14:50,"Atlanta, GA",21,15,2184,0,There isn't a totally clear pattern between the buyback reducing the share count and the year's dividend raise. $AAPL
2020-04-14 03:14:49,"Atlanta, GA",21,15,2184,0,"Actual timing of payments can be seen in the dividend history page linked below, and some of the early years have been adjusted to reflect the stock split that happened during this time. $AAPL"
2020-04-14 03:14:49,"Atlanta, GA",21,15,2184,0,"So when Apple increased the dividend to $0.77 per share last year, I gave that rate the ""2019"" year below. $AAPL"
2020-04-14 03:14:48,"Atlanta, GA",21,15,2184,0,"We haven't seen a major increase in total cash payments to the dividend in recent years. Overall though, the seven dividend raises we have seen have equaled an increase of 10.73% per year on a straight (not compounded) average. $AAPL"
2020-04-14 03:14:48,"Atlanta, GA",21,15,2184,0,"Interestingly enough, there have been times when Apple paid out less total quarterly cash than it did in the prior year period due to the strength of the buyback. $AAPL"
2020-04-14 03:14:47,"Atlanta, GA",21,15,2184,0,"Today, I'd like to preview the potential dividend raise as well as provide my thoughts on the status of the buyback plan.

$AAPL"
2020-04-14 03:14:47,"Atlanta, GA",21,15,2184,0,"Thanks to enormous profitability driving tremendous cash flow, the company has been able to return hundreds of billions of dollars to shareholders. $AAPL"
